1. Event dispatch

(rf/dispatch [:time-color-change "red"])
    Lähettää

2. dispatch puts an event into a queue for processing.

Event handlers can be registered via either

reg-event-fx or
reg-event-db (-fx vs -db).

Because of its simplicity, we’ll be using the latter here:
reg-event-db.

reg-event-db allows you to write
simpler handlers for the common case
where you want them to take only
one coeffect -
the current app state -
and return one effect -
the updated app state.

Here is the syntax of reg-event-db:

(rf/reg-event-db
  :the-event-id
  the-event-handler-fn)
